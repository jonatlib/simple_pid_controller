## üéØ PID Tuning Guide

A PID controller continuously corrects the difference between a **setpoint** and **measured value** using:

- **P (Proportional)**: reacts to present error
- **I (Integral)**: compensates for past error
- **D (Derivative)**: predicts future error trends

<details>
<summary><strong>1. Manual (Trial & Error)</strong></summary>

1. Set `Ki` and `Kd` to 0
2. Start with small `Kp` (e.g., 1.0)
3. Increase `Kp` until oscillations appear
4. Halve that `Kp` value
5. Increase `Ki` to reduce steady-state error
6. Add `Kd` to smooth out oscillations

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2. Ziegler‚ÄìNichols Method</strong></summary>

1. Set `Ki = 0`, `Kd = 0`, increase `Kp` until sustained oscillations
2. Measure:
   - **Ku** = critical gain
   - **Pu** = oscillation period
3. Apply:
   - `Kp = 0.6 √ó Ku`
   - `Ki = 1.2 √ó Ku / Pu`
   - `Kd = 0.075 √ó Ku √ó Pu`

</details>

### Common pitfalls with the I term

Several reported issues stem from the interaction between the **integral term** and the controller's configured limits. Keep the following points in mind when tuning:

- **Integral sensor shows the clamped output** ‚Äì The integration exposes a diagnostic entity for the I contribution. When `Output Min`/`Output Max` are set, the value you see in the UI is the clamped contribution after limits are applied. This means that with `Ki = 0` the integral value will simply remain at the boundary (e.g. `Output Min = 3` results in `I = 3`). This is expected behaviour and not a sign that the integral is "stuck".
- **Choose a suitable start value** ‚Äì When the controller is initialised it sets the integral term to the configured start value, but still clamps it within your `Output Min`/`Output Max` range. If you want the controller to begin from `0`, select the **PID Start Value** option `zero_start` (or call the `simple_pid_controller.set_output` service with the `preset` parameter) and temporarily widen the output range if needed. Otherwise the integral will be forced to the lowest allowed value.
- **Ki must be non-zero to change the integral** ‚Äì Setting `Ki = 0` effectively freezes the integral term. Use a small but non-zero value if you need the controller to move away from the clamp over time. You can combine this with **Windup Protection** (toggle entity) to prevent large overshoots once the setpoint is reached.

If your process requires a non-zero minimum output (for example, EV charging currents that must stay above 6 A), start your tuning with:

1. `PID Start Value = zero_start` so the controller can compute from a neutral baseline.
2. A modest proportional gain (`Kp`) that does not immediately drive the output below the minimum.
3. A small integral gain (`Ki`) to let the controller move away from the clamped value without causing overshoot.

These steps help avoid the "integral stuck at minimum" effect while keeping the controller within the bounds your hardware requires.

### How it works in practice

1. **Initialization**  
   - On startup (or when options change), we set up a single `sample_time` value (in seconds).  
   - We register a periodic callback with Home Assistant‚Äôs scheduler (`async_track_time_interval` or `DataUpdateCoordinator`) using that same `sample_time`.  

2. **Coordinator Tick**  
   - Every `sample_time` seconds, Home Assistant‚Äôs scheduler invokes our update method.  
   - We immediately read the current process variable (e.g. temperature sensor) and pass it to the PID logic.

3. **PID Logic & Output**  
   - The PID algorithm calculates the Proportional, Integral, and Derivative terms and writes the result to your target entity (e.g. a heater or set-point).

4. **Adjusting Sample Time**
   - Changing `sample_time` in your integration options takes effect at the end of the current interval‚Äîno Home Assistant restart is required.  
   - On the next tick, the coordinator will use the new interval.

## üîß Service Actions
The integration provides a `simple_pid_controller.set_output` service to adjust the controller output directly.

### `simple_pid_controller.set_output`
| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `entity_id` | PID output sensor entity to control (may be provided via `target`) |
| `preset` | Optional preset: `zero_start`, `last_known_value`, or `startup_value` |
| `value` | Optional manual value between configured `Output Min` and `Output Max` |

- When **Auto Mode** is off, the last output value is updated to the chosen value.
- When **Auto Mode** is on, the PID restarts from the new value and the coordinator refreshes.
- Exactly one PID output sensor entity must be targeted.

Example using `target`:

```yaml
service: simple_pid_controller.set_output
target:
  entity_id: sensor.spid_x_pid_output
data:
  value: 200
```

Example using `target`:

```yaml
action: simple_pid_controller.set_output
target:
  entity_id: sensor.spid_x_pid_output
data:
  value: 200
```
